Xain'd Sleena Pocket Core (Technos Japan Corp. 1986) by RndMnkIII
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This core comes from the MiSTer FPGA original implementation that I did 
in 2022. Is based in a bootleg board that doesn`t use the MC6870SPS protection MCU and
original romset by a patched one, that byapasses the MCU protection scheme. The remaining board
components are the same as the original PCB.
