Spiritualized Intellivision
Enjoy Intellivision games with this core.  The Intellioice is fully supported.

All Intellivision files (games and the EXEC) must be in the .intv format. 
Separate .H and .L files, and other formats are not supported.

To use this core, you need to place exec.intv into 

/Assets/intv/Spiritualized.Intv/exec.intv

For the Intellivoice, you need to place the 2048 byte 012.BIN file into

/Assets/intv/Spiritualized.Intv/012.BIN

See the readme.txt for more information on button mapping and the .intv format.

Enjoy!
