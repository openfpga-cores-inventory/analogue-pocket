Spiritualized GB 

Almost everything should be supported by this core.  

Be sure the following files are present before using!
* dmg_bios.bin file in /assets/gb/common/
* dmg_bios.bin must be exactly 256 bytes.

Note that the link port is fully supported but unless a GB or GBC cartridge is plugged in, it will run at 3.3V.

Rumble is supported if you plug in a DS rumble pak! A menu has been added to adjust rumble strength.
* 0 = off
* 1 = weak
* 7 = strong

Enjoy
