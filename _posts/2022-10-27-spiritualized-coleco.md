Spiritualized Colecovision

Regular, Super Game Module, EEPROM, and flash games are supported by this core.

You must place the Colecovision BIOS, named "coleco.bin" into the 

/assets/coleco/Spiritualized.Coleco/ folder!  It should be 8192 bytes in size.

These games utilize save memory and must have the correct extention to work:

Black Onyx should have the .CE0 file extention,
Boxxle needs the .CE1 extension, 
and Penguin Adventure and Gradius need a .CF0 extension.

See readme.txt for information on button mapping.


Enjoy!
