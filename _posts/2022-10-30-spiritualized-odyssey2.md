Enjoy Odyssey^2 games with this core.  The Voice is fully supported.

To use it, you must place the 2048 byte Odyssey^2 BIOS named "o2bios.bin" here:

/assets/odsyessey2/Spiritualized.Odyssey2/o2bios.bin

If you wish to use The Voice, the two voice 16384 byte files need to be placed here:

/assets/odsyessey2/Spiritualized.Odyssey2/SP128_03.BIN
/assets/odsyessey2/Spiritualized.Odyssey2/SP128_04.BIN

This core really benefits from a keyboard.  see the readme.txt for more info.

Enjoy!
