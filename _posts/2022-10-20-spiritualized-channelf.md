Spiritualized Channel F

Enjoy Channel F with this core.

To use it, you must place the 2048 byte Channel F BIOS named "cfbios.bin" here:

/assets/channel_f/common/cfbios.bin

A file named "play bios games.bin" has been included if you wish to play
the built-in games.  This is just an empty file which will make it think no
cartridge is inserted.

Enjoy!
