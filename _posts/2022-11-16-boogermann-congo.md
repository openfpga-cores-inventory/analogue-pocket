Congo Bongo is an isometric platform game and is Sega's take on Nintendo's legendary "Donkey Kong".
The player takes on the role of a red-nosed safari explorer by the name of Safari Sam, who tries to catch a gorilla named Bongo.

The game consists of four different scenes. Each is timed by a bonus counter in the upper left corner of the screen.
As time passes, the bonus decreases. If the bonus counter reaches zero, a player life is lost.

Note: You must provide your own roms to use this core.
