info: 'Xevious (pronounced ''zeevious'') is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up in
  which the player pilots the heavily-armed ''Solvalou'' combat ship and must destroy
  the evil Xevious forces trying to take over the planet. The Solvalou is equipped
  with two weapon systems; the forwards-firing "air zapper" for shooting air-based
  enemies and ''blaster bombs'', for destroying ground-based enemies. To enable accurate
  targetting of the air-to-ground blaster bombs, a white and blue targeting indicator
  is situated in front of the Solvalou. This flashes when an enemy is in its sights.
