info: "In 1962, the first digital video game, Spacewar! debuted on an early computer
  released in 1959 called the PDP-1 at MIT.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of video games.\r\n\r\nSpacewar!
  set forth and established the fundamental characteristics and philosophical approaches
  that would define and serve as the earliest guidelines of what a video game is.\r\n\r\nInspired
  by science fiction literature and cinema. Driven by creatively pushing technology
  to its limits.\r\n\r\nA new medium and art form was born.\r\n\r\nSpaceWar! was released
  on a computer produced in 1959 called the PDP-1. Spacewar! is arguably the first
  digital video game ever created.\r\n\r\nPDP-1 has been painstakingly recreated with
  the public domain open source code for openFPGA by Spacemen3. So it can be preserved,
  studied and played forever without compromises.\r\n"
