info: "Port by agg23. Core by srg320.\r\n\r\nSuper Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES),
  referred to as the Super Famicom (SFC) in Japan was the second home console produced
  by Nintendo. A 16-bit console that remains hugely popular to this day due to its
  expansive library and impressive enhancement chips.\r\n\r\nCore supports 4 controllers
  (when connected to the Dock), and the SA-1, Super FX (GSU), DSP, CX4, S-DD1, SPC7110,
  and BSX expansion chips. Please report all issues to agg23, as most likely any issues
  experienced are issues with the port, not the core."
