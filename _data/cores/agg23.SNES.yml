  info: "Port by agg23. Core by srg320.\r\n\r\nSuper Nintendo Entertainment System
    (SNES), referred to as the Super Famicom (SFC) in Japan was the second home console
    produced by Nintendo. A 16-bit console that remains hugely popular to this day
    due to its expansive library and impressive enhancement chips.\r\n\r\nCore supports
    4 controllers (when connected to the Dock), and the SA-1, Super FX (GSU), DSP,
    CX4, S-DD1, SPC7110, and BSX expansion chips. Please report all issues to agg23,
    as most likely any issues experienced are issues with the port, not the core."
