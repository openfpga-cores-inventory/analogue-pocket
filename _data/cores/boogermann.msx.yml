  MSX is a standardized home computer architecture, announced by ASCII Corporation on June 16, 1983.
  It was initially conceived by Microsoft as a product for the Eastern sector, and jointly marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, the director at ASCII Corporation.
  Microsoft and Nishi conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various home computing system manufacturers of the period,
  in the same fashion as the VHS standard for home video tape machines.
  The first MSX computer sold to the public was a Mitsubishi ML-8000, released on October 21, 1983, thus marking its official release date
