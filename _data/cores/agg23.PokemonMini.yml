    by Nintendo, similar to Tamagotchi, but with cartridge-based games. While it possesses
    a limited official library, it has various homebrew offerings as well that makes
    this a special little console.\r\n\r\nDue to the high potential refresh rate of
    the LCD (75Hz), the core may experience tearing. A quadruple buffer is used to
    attempt to mitigate this. Please report all issues to agg23, as most likely any
    issues experienced are issues with the port, not the core."
