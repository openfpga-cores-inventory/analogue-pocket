info: "Flappy Bird\r\n\r\nThis core is written entirely in discrete logic, apparently.
  Not recommended as a reference example.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nFlappy Bird is an arcade-style
  game launched in May 2013 and gained popularity in early 2014. The user controls
  the bird constantly moving to the right and the objective is to navigate the bird
  through pair of pipes that have gaps placed at random heights. The bird will ascend
  for a short distance if the player touches the screen (a button configured on FPGA)
  and ends if the bird falls to the ground or hits a pipe. Points are rewarded each
  time the player crosses a pipe.\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n* Press Flap\r\n* When you
  die, press reset.\r\n"
