info: "Modified to support the Analogizer adapter.\r\nPort by agg23. Core by Ludvig
  Strigeus, sorgelig, greyrogue, Kitrinx, paulb-nl, and many others.\r\n\r\nNintendo
  Entertainment System (NES), referred to as the Famicom in Japan was the first major
  home console produced by Nintendo. This console made gaming a household name, and
  is still popular to this day\r\n\r\nCore supports 4 controllers (when connected
  to the Dock), cartridge saves, and most mappers. Please report all issues to agg23,
  as most likely any issues experienced are issues with the port, not the core."
