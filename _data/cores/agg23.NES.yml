info: "Port by agg23. Core by Ludvig Strigeus, sorgelig, greyrogue, Kitrinx, paulb-nl,
  and many others.\r\n\r\nNintendo Entertainment System (NES), referred to as the
  Famicom in Japan was the first major home console produced by Nintendo. This console
  made gaming a household name, and is still popular to this day\r\n\r\nCore supports
  4 controllers (when connected to the Dock), cartridge saves, and most mappers. Please
  report all issues to agg23, as most likely any issues experienced are issues with
  the port, not the core."
