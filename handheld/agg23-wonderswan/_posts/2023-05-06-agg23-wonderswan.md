Port by agg23. Core by Robert Peip

WonderSwan, a handheld console by Bandai, had notably better specs than it's competitor, the Game Boy Color. With a 16-bit processor, 8 shades of grey color (later 241 colors), and long battery life, it stands out as a strong contender to Nintendo's dominance.

Supports:
* Memories
* Fast forward - Runs game at 2.5x speed
* CPU turbo
* Automatic screen orientation
* Flickerblending

Please report all issues to agg23, as most likely any issues experienced are issues with the port, not the core.
