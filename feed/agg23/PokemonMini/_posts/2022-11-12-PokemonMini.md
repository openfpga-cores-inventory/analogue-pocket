Port by agg23. Core by Grieverheart.

A small handheld console released by Nintendo, similar to Tamagotchi, but with cartridge-based games. While it possesses a limited official library, it has various homebrew offerings as well that makes this a special little console.

Due to the high potential refresh rate of the LCD (75Hz), the core may experience tearing. A quadruple buffer is used to attempt to mitigate this. Rumble is supported using rumble cartridges. Please report all issues to agg23, as most likely any issues experienced are issues with the port, not the core.
