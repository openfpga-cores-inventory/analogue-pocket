Port by agg23. MiSTer port by uXeBoy. Atmega core by Iulian Gheorghiu.

Arduboy is an open source video game console around the size of a credit card. Based on an Arduino core and a 128x64 OLED display, the system packs impressive games into a very small and simple formfactor.

Core may exibit strange audio behavior on a few games. The cause of this issue is unknown at this time. Settings are provided to tweak the audio output to make it more agreeable.
