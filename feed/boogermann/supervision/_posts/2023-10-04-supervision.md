Supervision © 1992 Watara.

The Watara Supervision, also known as the QuickShot Supervision in the UK, is a monochrome handheld game console, originating from Asia, and introduced in 1992 as a cut-price competitor for Nintendo's Game Boy.
It came packaged with a game called Crystball, which is similar to Breakout.
One unique feature of the Supervision was that it could be linked up to a television via a link cable.
Games played in this way would display in four colors, much like Nintendo's Super Game Boy add-on for the SNES.
A full color TV link was also in the works, but because of the Supervision's failure to make a major impression among gamers it was cancelled, along with the games which were in development for it.

This Implementation of a compatible Watara Supervision hardware in HDL is the work of Pierre Cornier and Jamie Blanks.
