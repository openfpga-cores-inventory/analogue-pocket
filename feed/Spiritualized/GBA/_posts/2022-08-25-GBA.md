Spiritualized GBA 

Almost everything should be supported by this core.  

Be sure your gba_bios.bin file is in /assets/gba/common/ before using!

Note that the link port is fully supported, and rumble is supported too if you plug in a DS rumble pak!

Currently Drilldozer is fully supported this way.  Warioware Twisted would be if there was a usable accelerometer...

Interactive menus have been added:
* High quality audio on/off
* Rumble strength (0 = off, 1 = weak, 7 = strong)
* Layer disable - this disables the various video layers for fun

Enjoy
