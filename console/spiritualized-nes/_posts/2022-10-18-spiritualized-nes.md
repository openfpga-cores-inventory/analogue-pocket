Spiritualized NES

NSF playing, FDS games, Vs. Games, and everything else should be supported by this core.

If you wish to play FDS games, make sure the file "fds.bios" is present in your
/nes/common/ folder!  If not, you will get a "file not found" error. 

When loading an FDS file for the first time, it must be processed.  This can
take several seconds, so don't be alarmed if the core appears to hang up for 
5-10 seconds.  Subsequent loading will be nearly instant.

Loading NSFs can take 2-3 seconds as well.

For Vs. games, press the left trigger (default) to insert coins.

Please see readme.txt for more information.
