Spiritualized Atari 2600

Most Atari 2600 things should be supported by this core.

Pretty much every mapper, RAM, and the Supercharger.

Line count and centering are automatically controlled and
should work for just about everything.

For information on interact menu items and required
files for certain features, please see the readme.txt

Enjoy!
